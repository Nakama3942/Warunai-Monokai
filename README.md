# template_rep
My template for repositories

This is a description of the project, its business card. Everything that needs to be said about the project should be here. Of course, it will need to be described every time, taking into account the specifics of the project, but the titles will be the same.

Например:

    Shields - icons that adorn readme.md and are links to specific pages
    Repository name - the name of the repository
    Overview - a brief description of the project;
    Usage - how to use the project;
    Building - how to start a project, what is needed for this;
    Troubleshooting - describes what problems you may encounter and how to solve them;
    
    CHANGELOG - a file that records all changes for new versions (you need to provide a link to it);
    CONTRIBUTING - a file that describes how you can contribute to the development of this project (you need to provide a link to it);
    CODE_OF_CONDUCT - a file that describes the rules for participating in the development of the project (you need to provide a link to it);
    PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE - template for those who will create a pull-request (you need to provide a link to it);
    
    Authors - do not forget about our loved ones.
